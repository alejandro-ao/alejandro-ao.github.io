Let's talk about PHP. More precisely, why it is a language that every web developer should know and what makes it so important.

Even though there is a huge amount of people that hate it or dislike it (myself included in the latter category) it is noble to recognise its importance. After all, it powers nearly 80% of all websites on the internet. Not so insignificant after all, right?

## What is special about PHP ?

How could we be interested in PHP? This old, rarely praised and almost ubiquitously hated technology, is also one of the most important skills that you should have in your tech skills to be a high performing web developer. 

PHP is a language that was born as a personal project and, originally it was not supposed to be widely used. As things are, it ended up being the language that powers 78.2% of all websites on the internet. Whether you like it or not, it will remain relevant to any web developer in the coming years.
