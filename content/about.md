## Welcome to my blog!

This is a fresh project that I started a few months ago. During the last year at my job as a web development, I have learned a lot about many different technologies, mainly around the LAMP stack.

Every time I learn something new, I try to write a short article about what I just applied. This helps me better understand the concepts and the processes that I use. 

The result is that I currently have a growing library of more than a hundred articles about all aspects of web development. The idea behind this blog is to publish those articles so they can be used by others.

You can see a list of my blog posts [here](posts)!

## Who am I?
My name is Alejandro. I am a self-taught web developer. I currently live in France and work as a full-stack web developer at a local agency. Do reach out to me if you want to discuss!

Bonne lecture.
